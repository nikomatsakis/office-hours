Hi! Welcome to my "office hours" repository. 

### Office Hours are on Hiatus. Please come back in November of 2019 ###

### TL;DR

If you want to sign up for some help, make your way to the appropriate
markdown file, find an available slot, and open a PR that adds your
name:

 - [October 2018 signups](2018/10.md)

### What is this?

Every week, I have a few "open slots" that I reserve to help people
work through problems that they are having with their Rust programs --
no problem is too big or too small! My goal with this is obviously to
help people, but also to gain some insight into what kinds of things
people find difficult about Rust, so that we can improve those
things. So, if you are a Rust user -- beginner or advanced -- and you
have a problem, you should sign up!

### The procedure

If you want to sign up, all you have to do is to open up the
appropriate Markdown file -- there is one per month. Find an available
slot and make a PR that adds your name. I'll try to merge PRs roughly
in the order they arrive, first thing in the morning. When the time
comes, we will be meeting in [my appear.in room][appear]. I plan to
add new months towards the end of each month.

**Confidentiality.** I will take notes on the problems that you bring
to me. I may write blog posts about some of my observations, though
without personal details. I would love it if you can make available
sources or links. If however you want to bring a problem where the
source is private, that's fine too.

**Experience levels.** Some of the slots are marked with experience
levels -- for example, some slots are designated for beginners.
Please try to pick a suitable slot for the level of your problem.

**No slots left?** Sorry, I wish I had time for everyone. I would
however recommend checking out the [Rust users board]. Lots of
friendly and knowledgable folks there. If you prefer synchronous chat,
there is also `#beginners` on the [Rust
discord](https://discord.gg/rust-lang) and `#rust-beginners` on
`irc.mozilla.org`. Finally, check out the [rust-learning] repository,
which has an encyclopaedic listing of stuff.

**No guarantees.** Sometimes last minute things come up and I have to
cancel. I'll try not to, though!

### Who I am

I'm @nikomatsakis, a member of the Rust core, language, and compiler
teams. I've been working on Rust for the last 7 years or so. I like it
and I hope you will, too!
