# October dates

## Instructions

Find a slot that says "unassigned" and seems suitable. Edit the file
to include your name and whatever details you care to give about your
problem -- if you can include a twitter handle or some other means of
contacting you, that'd be great, since sometimes I may have to cancel
last minute. Open a PR.

Note: in the PR, feel free to include alternative dates that would
work for you. In the event of a merge conflict, I may pick one of
those secondary dates.

Sergey Galich - using traits to abstract data storage for use in code and unit tests. There is a folder with JSON/binary files, which can be updated by app. We want to write unit tests to verify updating/merging changes to that folder, but without actually touching the disk (like in memory database).
