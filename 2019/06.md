# June dates

## Instructions

Find a slot that says "unassigned" and seems suitable. Edit the file
to include your name and whatever details you care to give about your
problem -- if you can include a twitter handle or some other means of
contacting you, that'd be great, since sometimes I may have to cancel
last minute. Open a PR.

Note: in the PR, feel free to include alternative dates that would
work for you. In the event of a merge conflict, I may pick one of
those secondary dates.

## Dates

**Monday, June 17**

Level: Beginner, sort of (mathematician)<br/>
Time: 10 - 10:30 (UTC-4)

Robert Jacobson - "I'm really interested to understand the mechanics of lifetimes in general and to relate it to things I already feel like I understand. If there is a mathematical answer to the question, 'Why aren't lifetimes inferred?,' then I'd understand lifetimes a lot better."; see [my questions in my post to r/rust
](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/bzx9hl/a_couple_of_complicated_questions_about_lifetime/).

I am available almost any time most days, as my time, though very busy, is very unstructured, allowing me to move things around. 
Alternatively, asynchronous communication via one of the following works, too.
